Description: CVPySDK
        =======
        
        CVPySDK is a Python Package for Commvault Software.
        
        CVPySDK uses Commvault REST API to perform operations on a Commcell via WebConsole.
        
        
        Requirements
        ------------
        
        - Python 2.7 or above
        - `requests <https://pypi.python.org/pypi/requests/>`_ Python package
        - `future <https://pypi.python.org/pypi/future>`_ Python package
        - `xmltodict <https://pypi.python.org/pypi/xmltodict>`_ Python package
        - Commvault Software v11 SP7 or later release with WebConsole installed
        
        
        Installing CVPySDK
        ------------------
        
        CVPySDK is available on GitHub `here <https://github.com/CommvaultEngg/cvpysdk>`_
        
        It can be installed from source. After downloading, from within the ``cvpysdk`` directory, execute::
        
            python setup.py install
        
        
        Using CVPySDK
        -------------
        
        Login to Commcell:
            >>> from cvpysdk.commcell import Commcell
            >>> commcell = Commcell(webconsole_hostname, commcell_username, commcell_password)
        
        Print all clients:
            >>> print(commcell.clients)
        
        Get a client:
        	>>> client = commcell.clients.get(client_name)
        
        Get an agent:
        	>>> agent = client.agents.get(agent_name)
        
        Get an instance:
        	>>> instance = agent.instances.get(instance_name)
        
        Browsing content at instance level:
        	>>> paths, dictionary = instance.browse(path='c:\\', show_deleted=True)
        
        Browsing content of a instance in a specific time range:
        	>>> paths, dictionary = instance.browse(path='f:\\', from_time='2010-04-19 02:30:00', to_time='2014-12-20 12:00:00')
        
        Searching a file in instance backup content:
        	>>> paths, dictionary = instance.find(file_name="*.csv")
        
        Get a backupset:
        	>>> backupset = instance.backupsets.get(backupset_name)
        
        Run backup for a backupset:
        	>>> job = backupset.backup()
        
        Browsing content at backupset level:
        	>>> paths, dictionary = backupset.browse(path='c:\\', show_deleted=True)
        
        Browsing content of a backupset in a specific time range:
        	>>> paths, dictionary = backupset.browse(path='f:\\', from_time='2010-04-19 02:30:00', to_time='2014-12-20 12:00:00')
        
        Searching a file in backupset backup content:
        	>>> paths, dictionary = backupset.find(file_name="*.csv")
        
        Get a subclient:
        	>>> subclient = backupset.subclients.get(subclient_name)
        
        Run backup for a subclient:
        	>>> job = subclient.backup(backup_level, incremental_backup, incremental_level)
        
        Browsing content at subclient level:
        	>>> paths, dictionary = subclient.browse(path='c:\\', show_deleted=True)
        
        Browsing content of a subclient in a specific time range:
        	>>> paths, dictionary = subclient.browse(path='f:\\', from_time='2010-04-19 02:30:00', to_time='2014-12-20 12:00:00')
        
        Searching a file in subclient backup content:
        	>>> paths, dictionary = subclient.find(file_name="*.txt")
        
        Run restore in place job for a subclient:
        	>>> job = subclient.restore_in_place(paths, overwrite, restore_data_and_acl)
        
        Run restore out of place job for a subclient:
        	>>> job = subclient.restore_out_of_place(client, destination_path, paths, overwrite, restore_data_and_acl)
        
        Job Operations:
        	>>> job.pause()		    # Suspends the Job
        	>>> job.resume()	    # Resumes the Job
        	>>> job.kill()		    # Kills the Job
        	>>> job.status		    # Current Status the Job  --  Completed / Pending / Failed / .... / etc.
        	>>> job.is_finished	    # Job finished or not     --  True / False
        	>>> job.delay_reason	    # Job delay reason (if any)
        	>>> job.pending_reason	    # Job pending reason (if any)
        
        
        Uninstalling
        ------------
        
        On Windows, if CVPySDK was installed using an ``.exe`` or ``.msi``
        installer, simply use the uninstall feature of "**Add/Remove Programs**" in the
        Control Panel.
        
        Alternatively, you can uninstall using the **pip** command::
        
        	pip uninstall cvpysdk
        
        
        Contribution Guidelines
        -----------------------
        
        1. We welcome all the enhancements from everyone although we request the developer to follow some guidelines while interacting with the ``CVPySDK`` codebase.
        
        2. Before adding any enhancements/bug-fixes, we request you to open an Issue first.
        
        3. The SDK team will go over the Issue and notify if it is required or already been worked on.
        
        4. If the Issue is approved, the contributor can then make the changes to their fork and open a pull request.
        
        Pull Requests
        *************
        - CVPySDK has 3 branches, namely:
            - **master**
            - **dev**
            - **test**
        
        - The contributor should *Fork* the **dev** branch, and make their changes on top of it, and open a *Pull Request*
        - The **test** branch will Synced with the **dev** branch after every **n** commits, depending on the commit size
        - The **master** branch will then be updated with the **test** branch, once everything is verified
        
         **Note:** The SDK team will not accept any *Pull Requests* on the **master** branch
        
        Coding Considerations
        *********************
        
        - All python code should be **PEP8** compliant.
        - All changes should be consistent with the design of the SDK.
        - The code should be formatted using **autopep8** with line-length set to **99** instead of default **79**.
        - All changes and any new methods/classes should be properly documented.
        - The doc strings should be of the same format as existing docs.
        
        Code of Conduct
        ***************
        
        Everyone interacting in the **CVPySDK** project's codebases, issue trackers,
        chat rooms, and mailing lists is expected to follow the
        `PyPA Code of Conduct`_.
