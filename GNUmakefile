# The first-level GNUmakefile
#
# Please copy this GNUmakefile to your new project, and modify the
# path to the Makefile.detect below.
#
# Please do NOT add anything else to this file. Customize the
# second-level Makefile instead.
#
# Two levels of makefiles are required to do the auto-detection.
# They can be avoided only by doing a pre-configuration like it happens
# in every GNU distribution. Unfortunately, this approach, though very
# beneficial, will require some major changes, and I exect it will be
# difficult to get approval for this.
